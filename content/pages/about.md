My name is Abdullah, I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with more than 10 years of experience in tech and machine learning engineering with designing, developing, and implementing complex AI models and ML pipelines, automation and systems. Possessing a strong computer science background and expertise in various programming languages and frameworks. Committed to staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field and am always seeking out new and innovative ways to solve complex problems as well as leading development teams and technical discussions. I am passionate about mentoring and training junior team members on machine learning techniques and best practices.

A fan of open source, actively publishing and contributing to open source projects at the same time working on open source identity verification projects using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. One of the open source projects that I have contributed to was used in Mars 2020 Helicopter Mission.

I developed many open source projects used by engineers and data scientists, some of them:
