My name is Abdullah Selek, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer and MSc AI Student.

I got my University degree in **Computer Science** more than 10 years ago, and I'm currently studying for my master's degree.

I developed many open source projects used by engineers and data scientists, some of them:

- [HerePy](https://github.com/abdullahselek/HerePy)
- [plant-disease-classification](https://github.com/abdullahselek/plant-disease-classification-tf)
